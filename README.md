<h1 align="center">Wordable</h1>

ðŸ¤– Wordable is a small, robust Discord bot to support and manage a daily word game in your server!

## Commands

- `/ping` - Replies with pong!
- `/guess {guess}` - Make a guess

## Contributing

I'm hopeful that these instructions are clear enough for you to clone everything and be able to contribute!

You'll need a couple of things: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you've got those, you'll want to open a Git Bash terminal somewhere, and run this:
```
git clone https://github.com/vtrodd/wordable
```

You'll next want to change directory to the newly created `wordable` folder from within that Git Bash terminal, using:
```
cd wordable
```
If you're working on a specific issue, you'll want to switch to a new branch with the relevant name, which you can do in the Git Bash terminal:
```
git checkout -b WI-XXX
```
And from there, still in that Git Bash window:
```
npm install
```

Prisma needs to generate the necessary schema from the one that's been defined:
```
npx prisma generate
```

If you want to be able to run this bot, you'll also need a `config.json` file in the directory, something like this:
```
{
  "TOKEN": "THIS IS YOUR BOT'S TOKEN (don't share this)",
  "CLIENT_ID": "THIS IS THE ID OF YOUR BOT"
}
```

Once you've got that config file, you should be able to start up the bot with this line in a terminal:
```
ts-node .
```
